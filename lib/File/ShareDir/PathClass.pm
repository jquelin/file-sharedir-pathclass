=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use File::ShareDir::PathClass '-all';
    my $dir = dist_dir("File-ShareDir-PathClass")
    # $dir is a Path::Class object now

    # - or -

    # $dir is a Path::Class object now


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is just a wrapper around L<File::ShareDir> functions,
transforming their return value to L<Path::Class> objects. This allows
for easier usage of the value.

Refer to L<File::ShareDir> (section FUNCTIONS) for a list of which
functions are supported.

C<File::ShareDir::PathClass> supports both a procedural and a clas
methods API.


=head2 Procedural mode

All functions are exportable. Nothing is exported by default, though.
One has to list which function(s) she wants to import.

Some groups are defined for your convenience:

=over 4

=item * C<all> - all available functions.

=back

Note that this module is exporting subs via L<Sub::Exporter>, so groups
are available either as C<:group> or C<-group>. One can also play any
trick supported by L<Sub::Exporter>, check its documentation for further
information.


=head2 Class method mode

Otherwise, functions are available as class methods, called as:

    File::ShareDir::PathClass->method();

In this case, one doesn't need to import anything during module use-age.
